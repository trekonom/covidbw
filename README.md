# covidbw

This is a personal repository which starting on Nov 14, 2021 provides a
collection of data on the state of vaccination against COVID-19 in the
German federal state of Baden-Wuerttemberg or as it is called: “The
Länd”.

# Data

-   The repository provides data on people partly or fully vaccinated in
    the counties of the Länd as CSV files by date of publication.

-   Additionally the repository contains a collection of the raw PDFs
    from which the data is extracted and which are published by the
    [Ministry of Social Affairs, Health and
    Integration](https://sozialministerium.baden-wuerttemberg.de). The
    most recent PDF containing a table of the number and the share of
    people vaccinated against COVID-19 could be downloaded from
